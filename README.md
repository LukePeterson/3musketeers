# The 3 Musketeers

The 3 Musketeers is a pattern for developing software in a repeatable and consistent manner. It leverages Make as an orchestration tool to test, build, run, and deploy applications using Docker and Docker Compose. The Make and Docker/Compose commands for each application are maintained as part of the applicationâ€™s source code and are invoked in the same way whether run locally or on a CI/CD server.
